Project by Yihan Shen, Jiacheng Yin, Bowen Yang, Jingkai Fu at Columbia DevFest 2024

## Overview
[see full design here](https://github.com/BWN133/V-Talk/blob/master/design_demo/canvas_v-talk-demo-240204_1525.pdf)
V-Talk is an innovative mobile app designed to offer "casual therapy" for white-collar professionals. In today's high-pressure environment, many find it difficult to seek traditional therapy due to stigma or lack of time. V-Talk addresses this by providing an anonymous, virtual space where individuals can connect, share, and express themselves freely, using virtual characters to enhance user privacy and engagement.

## Features

- **Anonymous Chatting**: Users engage in conversations through a virtual identity, ensuring privacy and freedom of expression.
- **Room Assignment**: An AI assistant asks users a few questions about their mood and dilemma, then assigns them a virtual character and a room with users facing similar challenges.
- **Virtual Characters**: Characters reflect users' moods and personalities, walking in themed rooms and starting live calls when they come close to another character.
- **Voice Privacy**: User voices are processed to mask identity, protecting privacy during live calls.

## Problem Scope

With reports indicating that 60% of office workers have worked while mentally unwell and a significant portion not seeking help, V-Talk aims to offer a proactive platform for mental health support, specifically tailored for white-collar professionals.

## How We Built It

- **Prototype**: Initial designs and scenarios were created using Figma.
- **Development**: The app was developed in Java using Android Studio, with a Firebase database for authentication and login features.
- **AI Integration**: We utilized transformers for sentiment analysis to pair users effectively and OpenAI Whisper for voice-to-text conversion, ensuring user privacy.

## Challenges

- Focusing on a target user group of white-collar professionals.
- Simplifying the therapy themes to ensure a straightforward user experience.
- Learning the technical stack of Android Studio and Firebase as newcomers to mobile app development.

## Accomplishments

- Successfully integrating Metaverse concepts with mental health support mechanisms.
- Creating a potential outlet for the stresses and challenges faced by white-collar professionals.

## What We Learned
